# ZINI - A Simple INI Parser Library

ZINI is a straightforward and lightweight library for parsing INI files in C. It allows you to read, write, and manage configuration files in the INI format efficiently. This library provides a simple interface for handling sections and key-value pairs within INI files.



The code is not 100% safe, I would this is not safe at all, and needs testing. I made this just to integrate INI File handling capabilites in my on going project "ZiChess". This project is just a prototype of how we can process INI File without the "handler" some INI Parsing Library uses. I plan to make a SingleHeader File in the future, so people can include this directly in their code, but i dont have the time to do that. Please contribute.
